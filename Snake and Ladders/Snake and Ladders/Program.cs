            There are also 3 ladders inside the grid.A ladder has 2 endpoints each in some cell. So, if you move to a cell having a ladder you can move to the other end of the ladder in exactly 10 seconds.
            Can you tell the minimum time in which you can move from X1, Y1 to X2, Y2.Your path may or may not involve the use of a ladder and the ladder can be used for moving in either direction. */
